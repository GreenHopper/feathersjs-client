`feathersjs-client`
A web component wrapper around the feathersjs-client library that also takes care of establishing a server connection.

A typical use case looks like this:

    <feathersjs-client app="{{app}}" server="{{url}}" connected="{{isConnected}}"></feathersjs-client>

When the server url is set, feathersjs-client tries to establish a connection to the server. Once this is successful
the `connected` attribute is set to true, the `feathersjs-connected` event is thrown and the `app` property is set.
The `app` property then can be used to access a feather.js service:

    var service = app.service('todos');
